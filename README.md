# eyepatch
Hides away Leetcode's Difficulty and Acceptance Rate columns.

Open Extensions tab in chrome, click "load unpacked extension...", choose the root folder and you're good to go.

It's also available on chrome store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leetcode-eye-patch/jmpkmcogglidbaggbahfidgcpjmeeomn

## Current issue
Hides away the "Accepted" text when submitting a problem.
UI too simple.

Feel free to contribute in any way!
