# eyepatch
This is a modified version of eyepatch which only hides premium problems on Leetcode, without changing visibility of other fields such as problem difficulty or stats.

Open Extensions tab in chrome, click "load unpacked extension...", choose the root folder and you're good to go.

Original is available on chrome store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leetcode-eye-patch/jmpkmcogglidbaggbahfidgcpjmeeomn
